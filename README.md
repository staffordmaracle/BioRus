## BKPN_metazoa_pullout_align.fa
The dataset that we used; it includes all sequences collected from all sample locations in FASTA format.

## BIOL_432_Final Project.pdf

## bkpn_unique.fa
A FASTA file including all of the unique sequences we found in the data.

## bkpn_abundant.fa
A FASTA file of the most abundant BLAST sequences.

## blast.R

## Outline.docx
Our project outline.

## Comparing datasets.rmd
Code used to run metagenomic analyses. 

## finaldiversity.R
Code used to comapre diversity metrics for the dataset.
